# The Mozilla Open Source Field Guide

## What is Open and Why Do We Do it?

The Mozilla Project was born in 1998 with the release of the Netscape browser suite source code. This was done with the intention of harnessing the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet to fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market. Within the first year, new community members from around the world had already contributed new functionality, enhanced existing features and became engaged in the management and planning of the project itself.

Open source and the co-creation of our products *is* Mozilla's Superpower. If we don't build things out in the open, we're not being true to who we are and we suffer for it. Conversely, by working out in the open and bringing talents and perspectives from outside the organization in - we gain a couple critical advantages:

1. **The ability to punch above our weight** and ship features, fix bugs and take on initiatives we would never be able to do with internal resources alone.
2. **See around corners** by getting exposure to ideas and initiatives early, with the resulting feedback shaping decisions while they are still young (versus having a bad idea make it all the way to execution/release).
3. **Enthusiastic buy-in and evangelism**, when we co-create software with volunteers around the world we gain evangelists for what we are doing and those people defend us in public and share our products with friends, family and others in their community. Because it's also their software that they made too. No amount of marketing engagement can achieve that sense of connection to a piece of software that someone gets from the pride of participating in its creation.

## Big Things to Remember

- **Make it _easy_ for your community to do important things**. Things like localization need to be easy in order to encourage adoption and use. If the community has to go back to the mother ship for every little thing, those little things will not happen.
- **Surprise is overrated**. Lilly states that "surprise is the opposite of engagement," and therefore Mozilla's goal is to "increase the 'inner circle' of participation." By allowing more people to participate in "core" decisions, the core grows, and the friction to actually get things done by a growing body of people grows along with it.
- **Communities are not markets: members are citizens**. It's therefore important to treat them like active, valuable participants in open source, not consumers thereof because, as Lilly notes, such citizens "don't just make products better. They make them _what they are_."

### Open vs. Transparent

**transparent**

Public, but not necessarily enabling participation.

**passively transparent**

Not private; decisions arenâ€™t actively hidden, but are difficult to locate. They may not even be documented. This is usually not done intentionally.

**actively transparent**

Everything is written down, is easily searchable and is locatable by interested parties. This requires intentional, sustained effort.

**open**

Public _and_ participatory. This requires structuring efforts so that "outsiders" can meaningfully participate (and become "insiders" as appropriate).
