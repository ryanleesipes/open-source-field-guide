# The Mozilla Open Source Field Guide

## What is Open and Why Do We Do it?

### The History - Mozilla was born Open

The Mozilla Project was born in 1998 with the release of the Netscape browser suite source code. This was done with the intention of harnessing the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet to fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market. Within the first year, new community members from around the world had already contributed new functionality, enhanced existing features and became engaged in the management and planning of the project itself.

### Why Be Open?

Open source and the co-creation of our products _is_ Mozilla's Superpower. If we don't build things out in the open, we're not being true to who we are and we suffer for it. But by working out in the open and bringing talents and perspectives from outside the organization in - we gain a few critical advantages:

1. **The ability to punch above our weight** and ship features, fix bugs and take on initiatives we would never be able to do with internal resources alone.
2. **See around corners** by getting exposure to ideas and initiatives early, with the resulting feedback shaping decisions while they are still young (versus having a bad idea make it all the way to execution/release).
3. **Enthusiastic buy-in and evangelism**, when we co-create software with volunteers around the world we gain evangelists for what we are doing and those people defend us in public and share our products with friends, family and others in their community. Because it's also their software that they made too. No amount of marketing engagement can achieve that sense of connection to a piece of software that someone gets from the pride of participating in its creation.

### What is Open?

#### Open vs. Transparent

**transparent**

Public, but not necessarily enabling participation.

**passively transparent**

Not private; decisions arenâ€™t actively hidden, but are difficult to locate. They may not even be documented. This is usually not done intentionally.

**actively transparent**

Everything is written down, is easily searchable and is locatable by interested parties. This requires intentional, sustained effort.

**open**

Public _and_ participatory. This requires structuring efforts so that "outsiders" can meaningfully participate (and become "insiders" as appropriate).

## Big Things to Remember about Working in the Open

- **Make it _easy_ for your community to do important things**. Things like localization need to be easy in order to encourage adoption and use. If the community has to go back to the mother ship for every little thing, those little things will not happen.
- **Surprise is overrated**. Former Mozilla Corporation CEO John Lilly stated that "surprise is the opposite of engagement," and therefore Mozilla's goal is to "increase the 'inner circle' of participation." By allowing more people to participate in "core" decisions, the core grows, and the friction to actually get things done by a growing body of people grows along with it.
- **Communities are not markets: members are citizens**. It's therefore important to treat them like active, valuable participants in open source, not consumers thereof because, as Lilly notes, such citizens "don't just make products better. They make them _what they are_."
- **People yell because they want to be heard**. Most folk don't like confrontation. Most don't enjoy being yelled at. The thing to remember is that the folk yelling feel like they're not being heard. Taking the time to listen, talk, and address their concerns can help both sides understand the bigger picture. Often the loudest critic can become the greatest advocate, but it takes work. Treat folk the way we wished we were treated when we had that same level of frustration and anger, and often the sharp edges disappear.
- **Embrace imperfection**. You are a human being. You make mistakes as do many others. Mistakes can be fixed and lessons can be learned. The greater problem is thinking you are perfect and that you have nothing to learn. That said, there are skills one can develop when talking with people. If you feel you don't have them, reach out to someone you think may and have them join you so you can learn. "It's like a customer service gig. Most folk may like it, some won't and a vocal number will complain. Those complaints are a fraction of the people who care about your code."

## Resources

Over the years, Mozilla has gained a lot of knowledge about working in the open, and we've tried to share it. That said, we still have a lot to learn.

Here are some of the lessons we've talked about in the past:

- [Working Open Workshop](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/) - A collection of presentation slides, worksheets and other docs from a Conference track about working Openly.

- [Open Leadership Training Series](https://github.com/mozilla/open-leadership-training-series/blob/gh-pages/_articles/readme.md) - A training session built with the Mozilla Community about building and maintaining a community supported project.

## What is "A Community"

The [Mozilla Credits FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/credits/faq/) does a fair job of describing members of the Community as those that "made a significant investment of time, with useful results, into Mozilla project-governed activities". The FAQ details what some of those terms mean, but understand that there are no strict definitions. It's fuzzy because most things involving people and social interactions are fuzzy.

Working with a Community is working with a group of peers that help build, guide, and support a product. They are a huge asset to any project and can provide insight and assistance that you may not have thought possible. That said, they can be opinionated and, since they do not have access to all the information you do, may need to have things explained and clarified. Communication is paramount, both informing the Community of needed directions, as well as listening to the Community on requirements and concerns.

# How to be Open

Now that we know what "Open" means and what "Community" in the Mozilla context is, we can move on to *how* to co-create and build great projects and initiatives within Mozilla.
