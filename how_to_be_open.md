# How to be Open

So far we've covered how to be open in a very broad sense, but there is a lot of nuance in the practice of being open. This section aims to lay out practical best practices for those standing up and running open source projects.

## Governance

## Who Interacts With the Public?

In order to actually be open and participatory, all members of a community must be encouraged to speak publicly about the project. For instance, in the case of Thunderbird, all staff and volunteers who work on it are encouraged to engage with fans and critical alike on social media, Reddit or other forums. Having all public messaging need to be reviewed by a marketing department or leadership creates a strict hierarchy that kills engagement. Communities where members worry about "saying the wrong thing" in public stop being communities.

By empowering everyone to speak on behalf of Mozilla in the open, in the capacity they occupy, is to allow full participation. The result is that a communications team or marketing department doesn't have to run around responding to everything. Others will show up and evangelize, defend and explain the efforts - with greater reach than could be achieved through a more rigid, controlled method.

### A Note: On Saying the Wrong Thing

To expand on this concept of saying the wrong this gets at the heart of an issue that must be addressed. Allowing people to speak from the position they occupy in the community allows people to get it wrong.

Where this has worked well. we encourage people to say something like, "I'm a developer working on calendar in Thunderbird and this isn't my area, but I believe the answer to your question about the roadmap is [insert answer here]." Of course, they could ask another person with more knowledge to chime in, or for help on the correct answer. But the end goal is greater engagement from the people who normally participate in the spaces where the conversation is happening.

As an example, people that check r/Firefox (on Reddit) every day and are a part of that community out of personal interest - should be the ones engaging with the conversations there, empowered to do so and supported. They'll have the greatest understanding of the norms and temperaments, and will be respected more than an outsider.
